From basic home theaters to large-scale networking infrastructures, OvrC empowers pros to keep everything running smoothly.
 My work on OvrC has largely revolved around enabling configuration of our audio, video, and surveillance brands, Binary, Luma, Episode and Sunbrite.

Binary uses the network as the backbone to send 4K HDR content from any number of sources to any number of displays, creating a completely scalable solution for commercial and residential spaces. Binary delivers premium media eperiences with strength, quality, and reliability for years to come and is scalable for sources or displays that may be added in the future.
