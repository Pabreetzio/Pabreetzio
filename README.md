# Hi, I'm Patrick Graham :wave:

<div style="display:flex"><img src="snap-one-logo.gif" style="height: 100px;"/>
I currently work at Snap One as a senior software development engineer. At Snap One we design, manufacture, and distribute smart solutions for homes and businesses to make life better -- all installed and supported by trusted professionals worldwide.</div>

## Here's What I Do
<img src="ovrc-logo.webp" style=" float:left;" />I work on OvrC (oversee), a revolutionary support platform for professionals that allows them to remotely manage, configure, and troubleshoot devices on the network. From basic home theaters to large-scale networking infrastructures, OvrC empowers pros to keep everything running smoothly.
 My work on OvrC has largely revolved around enabling configuration of our Binary and Luma brands.

  <img src="binary-logo.webp" style="display:inline-block; float:right;"/>Binary offers media distribution solutions fo every installation using Media over IP. Media over IP (MoIP) is the mdern way to do AV distribution. Binary uses the network as the backbone to send 4K HDR content from any number of sources to any number of displays, creating a completely scalable solution for commercial and residential spaces. Binary delivers premium media eperiences with strength, quality, and reliability for years to come and is scalable for sources or displays that may be added in the future.
  
<img src="luma-logo.webp" style="display:inline-block; float:left;"/> Luma is survailance built for ultimate peace of mind. Luma survailance systems provide home and business owners with a reliable way to monitor and control cameras through a simple and intuitive interface, complete with advanced playback and recording capabilities. The luma app even allows users to check scenes at any time and view history of what has happened in/around the area over the past week.
